% This chapter should include:
% - NUMA architectures descriptions
\cite{Virouleau2016b}, Using data dependencies to improve task-based scheduling strategies on numa architectures

\cite{Broquedis2010}, hwloc: {A} Generic Framework for Managing Hardware Affinities in {HPC} Applications

% - Various examples (idchire, idkat, idbool?, brunch, random 16 cores 2 nodes
% - Key points (bandwidth, latency, cache coherence protocol, ...)

\cite{Dice2013}, Scalable statistics counters

\cite{Libutti2014}, Exploiting performance counters for energy efficient co-scheduling of mixed workloads on multi-core platforms

\cite{Li2013}, Characterization of Input/Output bandwidth performance models in NUMA architecture for data intensive applications

\cite{Olivier2013}, Characterizing and mitigating work time inflation in task parallel programs

% - How to benchmark/modelize this (if possible)
%     - Behavior with regards to task's instructions, data used, etc
%     - Introduce the tool to "watch" specific kernels behavior, and get numbers
%     - Get traces and numbers from inside the runtime / compare
