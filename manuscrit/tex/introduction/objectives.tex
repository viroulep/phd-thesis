\section{Objectives}\label{sec:intro:objectives}

Amongst all the possible research topics mentioned above, the scope of this thesis was restricted in the following way:

- Study focused on shared memory, NUMA architectures
- Several programming languages are available to target these architectures, however this study was focus on the de-facto standard: OpenMP.

In this context, the objectives of the thesis were to:
 - Evaluate the language, and understand the behavior of the underlying architecture.
 - Propose and evaluate evolutions to the language and the softwares, in order to improve performances.


Focused on task-based application, some other stuff (eg: jacobi).
The first contribution is several benchmarks (kastors, replay tool).
This lead to several intuitions about possible improvements to the OpenMP language and runtimes.
Which lead to two contributions:
 - The proposal for an task-to-data affinity clause in OpenMP
 - Runtime extensions to take advantage of data locality, and better data distributions.
