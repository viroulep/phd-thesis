\section{Objectives}\label{sec:intro:objectives}

Amongst all the possible research topics mentioned above, the scope of this thesis was restricted in the following ways:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The thesis was focused on shared memory, NUMA architectures
  \item Several programming languages are available to target these architectures, however this thesis was focused on the de-facto standard: OpenMP.
\end{itemize}

In this context, the objectives of the thesis were to:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Evaluate the language with regards to the current architectures.
 \item Propose and evaluate evolutions to the language and the softwares, specifically the runtime, in order to improve performances.
\end{itemize}

Additionally to that, most of the work has been done in the context of task-based application (TODO: ref section suivante?), even though some attention has been given to loop-based programs.

The evaluation of the OpenMP language was conducted over several runtimes and lead to the design of a benchmark suite and a tool to facilitate the controlled execution of specific benchmarks.
The lack of support in OpenMP to target NUMA architectures was highlighted.
Parts of this thesis was focused on improving usage of the information available to the runtime, as well as on enabling the programmer to pass more information to the runtime.

Which lead to two contributions:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The proposal for an task-to-resource affinity clause in OpenMP
 \item Runtime extensions to take advantage of data locality, and better data distributions.
\end{itemize}
