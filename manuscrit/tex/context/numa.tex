\section{Shared memory architectures}\label{sec:context:numa}



\subsection{Single node design}

Talk about cache hierarchy, maybe give some number and a drawing of how it looks like?

Typically 3 level of caches (explain size, performances)

Efficient sequencial code should focus on improving L1/L2 usage.

Our interest for parallel programming will focus on L3, see next section.

\subsection{Interconnecting nodes}

Talk about how nodes are interconnected with each other, give some numbers (?) and some drawing.
