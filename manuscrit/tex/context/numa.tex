\section{Shared memory architectures}\label{sec:context:numa}



\subsection{Cache hierarchy}

Describe the architecture:

One node, then multiple node

\subsection{Interconnecting nodes}

The memory topology is organized by pairs of NUMA nodes connected together through Intel QuickPath Interconnect.
These pairs can communicate together through a proprietary fabric called NUMALink6 with up to two hops.
%, represented by the edges of the graph.In other words, taking node $n_0$ as example :
%\begin{itemize}
%\item node $n_0$ communicates with node $n_1$ through Intel QPI ;
%\item node $n_0$ is one hop away from node $n_4$ \emph{(e.g. communications between node $n_0$ et node $n_4$ cross one NUMALink6 memory controller)};
%\item node $n_0$ is two hops away from node $n_{20}$ \emph{(e.g. communications between node $n_0$ et node $n_{20}$ cross two NUMALink6 memory controllers)};
%\end{itemize}
