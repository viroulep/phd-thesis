% This chapter should include
%\begin{itemize}
  %\item HPC ? (OpenMP (with ref to the "main" chapter for details), other existing languages)
  %\item NUMA (with ref to the "main" chapter)
  %\item task + Workstealing (with ref to the "main" chapter)
  %\item Related work
%\end{itemize}

%\input{tex/characterization}
% This chapter should include:
% - NUMA architectures descriptions
% - Various examples (idchire, idkat, idbool?, brunch, random 16 cores 2 nodes
% - Key points (bandwidth, latency, cache coherence protocol, ...)
% - How to benchmark/modelize this (if possible)
%     - Behavior with regards to task's instructions, data used, etc
%     - Introduce the tool to "watch" specific kernels behavior, and get numbers
%     - Get traces and numbers from inside the runtime / compare
% - Get some conclusion : what matter from now on


%\input{tex/OpenMP on numa}
% Big section to describe how we use/extend OpenMP to exploit these architectures

% - Description of OpenMP language (tasking and such)
% - Description of OpenMP runtime

% - Motivating examples for our works using current OpenMP

% - Missing to improve things
%    - What we implemented
%    - What remains


%\input{tex/exp}
% This chapter should include:
% - Hardware description
